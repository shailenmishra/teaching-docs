## Your voice is in reader's hands

> **Patrick Thomas**: Reading is itself a *constructive act*—quite literally, reading is meaning making. From the perspective of the reader, then, being a part of an audience has power. Much of that power lies in the ways readers infer an author’s voice into a text.

> **Patrick Thomas**: Recognizing that an author’s voice is a characteristic created by the reader, the concept and efforts to develop it occupy a less prominent role in the development of writing ability than writing teachers commonly give it credit for. On the other hand, letting go of the myth of the author’s voice *allows for a number of possibilities* that help writers develop their work.

## Your voice is in reader's hands

> **Patrick Thomas**: First, letting go of this myth de-mystifies the practice of writing. Prioritizing voice stifles necessary kinds of invention practices needed to produce writing in the first place, because the priority of authenticity or unique ability over content makes writers edit themselves before they’ve even started writing. [*how self-consciousness can pressure us to edit too quickly*]

> **Patrick Thomas**: Second, de-bunking the myth of the author’s voice helps to remove the stale notion that writing is some kind of divined gift, talent, or genetic trait that some people have and others do not.

## Your voice is in reader's hands

> **Patrick Thomas**: Third, laying bare the myth of the author’s voice draws attention to aspects of good writing that reflect what readers want and need.

> **Patrick Thomas**: Fourth, removing the myth of the author’s voice helps to provide a larger, more cumulative picture of how writing functions in the world. Scholars call this intertextuality—the ways writing emerges from, builds on, responds to, acts upon, and provides for other writing.

> **Patrick Thomas**: Finally, relieving ourselves of the myth of the author’s voice empowers readers to consider the ways their own abilities to make meaning have an impact on the subjects they care about. It also provides a way to explain how multiple, even competing interpretations of a text can be developed through careful, critical reading practices.

## How to write for public audiences?
Why did I assign this Substack article by Jenn Mcclearen?

>**Jenn Mcclearen**: Several people use Substack as a place to work through ideas and get feedback from the online community they have built, while others use it as a primary place to publish their polished ideas.

Since your Project 1 will be similar to a Substack-style newsletter, I want you to know what Substack is about: what's the **genre**, what's the **rhetorical situation**, what type of **audience** to envision and imagine, what are the **constraints** of the genre, how the **purpose** is communicated by the writers on Substack, what **modes of communication** to use, etc.?

## Audience expectation

>**Jenn Mcclearen**: the accessibility of your work is relative, and you must determine what your target audience reads and what writing mechanics they are used to. You must also consider their level of familiarity with your topic and adjust your language and tone accordingly.

> **Jenn Mcclearen**: The reality is that publicly engaged writing reaches a wide range of audiences, and understanding them is critical to communicating with any of them.

## On writing a Substack piece
Or more generally when producing a piece of public writing: 

> **Jenn Mcclearen**: adapting your style and voice to your intended readership will help you effectively communicate your message.

> **Jenn Mcclearen**: writing a book is not the same as writing a 500-word think-piece for a news outlet, how these tips look in practice varies greatly.

- Tell a story
- Use simple sentences and an active voice (?)
- Use plain language

## Building a niche audience on Substack

>**Jenn Mcclearen**: You get to choose when and how you write, but you must put in the effort to grow your audience. Plenty of scholars build fairly large audiences, but that often depends on a large level of effort invested, a sexy topic, and a knack for engaging writing.

>  **Jenn Mcclearen**: Understanding your audience is crucial, as is acknowledging that the accessibility of your work is relative and adjusting your language and tone accordingly for the specific audience you wish to reach.

## What should your Substack look like?

- An idea of what your Substack or newsletter is **about**. This is something you'll have to develop first before writing project 1.  
- Figuring what sort of **public** you'll be writing for, or what kind of **public writing** you want to produce
- *Note*: I'll be bit particular about the structure of your newsletter, and it will look differently that Emily Atkin's or Jenn Mcclearen's post   
- *Note*: You will not be actually starting a newsletter on Substack; rather you'll be mimicking the motions of it. Additionally, you'll compose your newsletter in the Notion.so template that I'll provide you.

## List of stylistic concepts

Note: The below definitions or explanations are *not* own my words in most cases. They're either borrowed from the book *The Writer's Style* by Paul Buttler or various other dictionaries. 

- **content vs style**, a false dichotomy: *How* something is said—its style—is 
intrinsically related to *what* is said—its content.
- **rhythm**, a stylistic feature that creates  expectations in readers, helping us anticipate what will follow.
- **allusion**: an apparent reference
- **context**: the style we adopt, exist not in a void or vacuum but in a specific context—the setting, situation, or occasion in which we write or speak about a certain topic.
- **purpose**: Another part of using style in a specific context is our purpose. A purpose is always present behind our words, even if we are not fully aware of or able to articulate it. Some examples of that purpose are to amuse, to persuade, to inform, or to get someone’s attention.
- **audience**: include those who read or hear what we say and respond to it. Any audience likely includes some individuals favorably disposed to what we say, but how about those resistant or opposed to our ideas? In writing or speaking, it is helpful to think about what audiences need from us at any given moment to understand and follow our meaning. The audience can determine what style we adopt in a specific context.
- **effects**: In addition, style shares with rhetoric a focus on the effects of words, which may be identical to, or different from, what we intend them to be. For example, the effects may be to move readers or listeners, to cause them to act, to inspire them, or to make them calm or angry. The effects may appeal to our thoughts or emotions, eliciting a rational or logical response (logos), one tied to feelings (pathos), or one based on trust in a writer (ethos).
- **rhetorical appeals**: logos (logical response), pathos (tied to feelings), ethos (tied to credibility or trust)
- **diction**: refers to word choice
- **syntax**: refers to word order or arrangement in a sentence. A writer’s decision about which words to use and in what order can have a large effect on meaning.
- **personification**: giving human-like attributes to inanimate objects, non-human beings or abstract ideas
- **parataxis**: phrases or clauses that are logically connected but without the help of a coordinating (like "and") or subordinating (like "so" or "because") conjunction. For example, the famous phrase attributed to Julius Caesar, "I came, I saw, I conquered." You would expect a conjunction between the phrases "I came" and "I saw" as is the norm in formal speech. But even with the absence of conjunctions, Caesar's line still makes perfect sense.
- **hypotaxis**: when subordinating conjunction is used to signal dependency of one clause with another.
- **simile**: a figure of speech in which two dissimilar things are compared with "like" or "as"
- **onomatopoeia**: a word formed of the very sound it describes, such as murmur, gargle, etc.
- **isocolon**: A figure of speech in which a sequence of phrases or clauses are of similar length. For example, Julius Caesar's line "I came, I saw, I conquered" is an example of isocolon.
- **assonance**: Resemblance of sound, especially of the vowel sounds in words; the repetition of the same vowel sound, with “sauce” and “toss.” This might help in attaining certain kind of effect and making the text memorable. 
-  **anastrophe**: with the reversal of the normal word order, the scheme of anastrophe, changes the sentences’ usual syntax: For example, in the Bible, lines like "Blessed are the meek” and "Blessed are the peacemakers" are examples of reversed word order of more standard expression in contemporary English: "The meek are blessed...The peacemakers are blessed." This reversal of word order allows for the emphasis of the word "blessed."
- **anaphora**: repetition of the same word or phrase at the beginning of successive sentences or clauses. In Martin Luther King Jr.'s famous speech: "I have a dream that one day on the red hills of Georgia,...I have a dream that one day, even the state of Mississippi,...I have a dream that my four little children will one day live in a nation,...I have a dream that one day down in Alabama..."  The frequent repetition of the word elevates the importance of it.
- **metaphor**: an implied comparison between two unlike things (compared to simile, we don't use "like" or "as")
- **alliteration**: the repetition of usually initial consonant sounds in two or more neighboring words or syllables (such as wild and woolly, thrifty and thriving) 
- **epanalepsis**: repetition of the same word after intervening words. For example, "Narrow is the mansion of my soul; enlarge *Thou* it, that *Thou* mayest enter in."
- **antimetabole**: a verbal pattern in which the second half of an expression is balanced against the first but with the words in reverse grammatical order (as in A-B/B-A or A-B-C/C-B-A) is called antimetabole. Pronounced as "an-tee-meh-TA-bo-lee," it is essentially the same as **chiasmus**. An example would be this saying by Malcolm X: "We didn't land on Plymouth Rock; Plymouth Rock landed on us."
- **parallelism**: at the level of sentence or clause, it mean a similarity in structure, meaning a pattern of syntactic structure that parallels itself between adjacent sentences or clauses. So, isocolon, antimetabole, or anaphora will all be different types of parallelisms, whereas rhetorical devices like alliterations and assonances are more precisely known as phonological parallelisms.       
- **ellipsis**: a figure of syntax, by which one or more words, which are obviously understood, are omitted. From Tom Junod's article “The Falling Man”: "They jumped through windows already broken and then, later, [they jumped] through windows they broke themselves." Junod withholds the use of “they jumped” at the start of the second clause, where it would normally go, instead using ellipsis.

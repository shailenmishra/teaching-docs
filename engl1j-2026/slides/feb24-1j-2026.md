## How culture shapes "nature"
> **Corbett**: Much of what we perceive nature to be is as much—maybe more—about cultural influences and social norms as it is about our experiences with it...No matter the animal and my experience with it—skunk, ladybug, whale, worm—I carry cultural expectations and stereotypes with me, and I know whether to feel afraid, happy, in awe, or grossed out.

---

## Our tangled reality
> **Corbett**: The nature/culture divide we cling to is both inaccurate and unhelpful, for humans are embedded in a tangled web of acting and being acted upon...the fantasy that we humans are somehow in charge of all those things prevents us from seeing our connection to all matter, which all emanates from the earth.

---

## Tracing the matter in the things we carry
> **Corbett**: I toured my house to see its contents through a *vibrant matter* lens: my bed pillow, the nightstand, my coffee mug, tomatoes, the kitchen radio, paper everywhere, the wheelbarrow, my cell phone. These vital objects did affect and alter me, and I could envision bits of nature within, though in most cases, *I was utterly ignorant about what earth elements comprised them, where those came from, and how they were transformed*. And energy (utterly vibrant matter) was involved in each transformation and each delivery into my life. It sparked many questions I knew I would never answer...

## The "distancing" of matter
> **Corbett**: And with distancing, comes a dramatic change in valuation. I value my cell phone more than the anonymous distant pieces of nature that formed it. How ironic that my phone shrunk and compromised the very wild nature I seem to value most—the same phone I use to take pictures of it.

## Power of being outdoors
> **Corbett**: Besides physical healing, time in nature—even wee bits of it—restores brain functions, such as ability to pay attention, perform various tasks, and be creative, all documented in a mounting number of scientific studies. Natural environments (meaning environments not dominated by human structures or pavement) are soothing because they allow for a gentle fascination and soft attention to objects and stimuli, in contrast to the sudden, switching, and demanding stimuli of our modern lives (ding, I just received  a text). A key characteristic of healing nature is the ability to engage all of our senses, for which we need quiet places without cars, buildings, or other human trappings.

## Good animal vs. bad animal
> **Corbett**: In an exercise in my environmental communication class, students list animals on two blackboards, one labeled “good” and one “bad.” Quickly and with relatively little disagreement, they fill both boards. Then we examine what lies behind our gut reactions; what is it about charismatic megafauna that we like and about insects that we don’t?

## Good animal vs. bad animal
> **Corbett**: Based on extensive surveys, over twenty different factors influence whether we like or dislike certain animal species, such as size (we prefer large over small), intelligence, mode of locomotion (we like animals that walk instead of slither), and evolutionary closeness to humans (we like chimps). We prefer zoomorphism (animals who bond to humans), animals with individual personalities, and animals with relationships to human society (such as pets, farm animals, game, and exotic animals). We like animals with similar social habits, like parenting, pack loyalty, and helping  each other. We are less magnanimous toward animals capable of harming us or our possessions, like crops or gardens. The students put black bear on the “good” board and grizzly bear on the “bad.”

## Good animal vs. bad animal
Corbett: 
#### [W]e like animals “like us,” even if we are reluctant to put ourselves in the “animal” camp. This inhibits our ability to see who many animals are and all that we share physiologically with them.

---

## Our connection with non-human animals
> **Corbett**: Our attitudes toward animals are not merely the result of photos, plush toys, and beer commercials but of ancient influences. Biologist E. O. Wilson claims that our evolutionary heritage created *biophilia* (the innate tendency to connect with other forms  of life) as well as evolution-derived fears and prejudices toward certain animals. Over millennia, our brains and bodies evolved through participation in the animal world as both prey and predator, thus animals are justifiably at the heart of human symbolism.

## Our connection with non-human animals
> **Corbett**: In today’s culture, we believe electronic encounters make us more connected and shrink the world. But as philosopher David Abram argues, the primary lesson you learn watching nature programs “is that nature is something you look at, not something you are in and of.” The cams do allow me to enter the bear’s watery restaurant as a silent voyeur half a world away. But there is no investment on my part, no consequences. I’m not sitting on the bank swarmed by mosquitoes, I cannot smell the rotting fish, and I’m in no danger from these talented carnivores. Do I have a stake in any outcome—theirs or mine? I’m entertained, I’m awestruck, but am I “connected”?

## Our connection with non-human animals
> **Corbett**: Humans seem to feel safest with boundaries: inside/outside, private/public, wild/tame, nature/culture. Yet any such division demarcates two separate worlds—when there is only one world available. And we long to be in that same world with our Kin, a longing that is a deep-rooted piece of who we are, as imbued in our language and dwellings as in our hearts.

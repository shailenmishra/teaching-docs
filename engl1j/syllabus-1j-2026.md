## Course Description

This course will ask students to explore the tools of oral and written persuasion across academic and non-academic writing genres. Students will engage with such questions as how do we listen and empathize with a diverse range of views in order to argue from one's own position? How does the motivation "to persuade" shape a rhetorical situation? How do we use a range of resources, such as rhetorical traditions, genre knowledge, and multimodality, to speak to different audiences? Students will be able to critically examine how persuasion works in their own communications and the communications of others in real contexts.

The theme of the course will be environmental awareness and environmental rhetoric. Focus will be specifically on different modes of rhetoric that inform environmental rhetoric and how knowledge of such rhetoric can lead to better ecological consciousness. Too often the understanding of rhetoric (meaning the ability to persuade someone) is limited to the classical Western and anthropocentric standards on the subject. This course offers *other* understandings of rhetoric such as animal rhetoric, multimodal/multi-sensory rhetoric, indigenous rhetoric (rhetoric based on land, story and community), and embodied rhetoric. With your introduction to these different types of rhetoric, you will be in a position to develop a diverse way of thinking about rhetoric/persuasion and consider its application in your daily reality. Even though the topical focus of this course is on environmental awareness and ecological issues, the different types of rhetoric you will learn in this course can inform your ability to write for a range of academic, personal and professional communication situations.

There will be three projects that you will complete in this course:

1. You will conduct rhetorical analysis of a persuasion campaign employed by an organization or entity dedicated to climate action (for example analyzing persuasion strategies adopted by the Office of Sustainability at Swarthmore in their public-facing communication genres); in this assignment you will use the rhetorical concepts you have learned and readings up to Week 5 to conduct rhetorical analysis.
2.  You will do a poster presentation to the Swarthmore community on an ecological issue of your choice after completing a guided tour of the Crum Woods and Scott Arboretum. You will also present an argument as part of the presentation, you will invite the community's feedback on the topic, and you will write a final reflection paper on what you learned in terms of the rhetorical engagement your topic demands.
3.  You will write a research essay on a topic that stretches the norms and expectations of academic writing (by that I mean the Western standards of academic rhetoric). This is a more open-ended project, meaning you can write on topics not limited to environmentalism. Nevertheless, the rhetorical strategies you employ to complicate and problematize the genre of academic research essay should be informed by embodied rhetoric, a concept that you will learn through our in-class readings and discussions, and out-of-class activities.

## Schedule

[Weekly schedule](https://shailenmishra.com/teaching-docs/engl1j/schedule-1j-2026.html) for the course is available for your review.

##  Texts

- *Out of the Woods: Seeing Nature in the Everyday* by Julia Corbett, First Edition, ISBN 978-1943859887. This is a required text and students are expected to purchase a copy.
- Other readings in the course will come from scholarly journals, book chapters, and web sources, and they will be made available to you in html or pdf format.

## Grade Distribution

Total course grade (100%) will be divided into several components:

1.  Writing projects (three in total): 75%
2.  Class participation & discussion posts: 15%
3.  Reflection assignments: 10%

One note on the grade distribution: commitment to the writing process will play a crucial role in this course and it is factored in the different stages involved in each writing assignment. It's important that you complete all the components of each assignment, and pay attention to and document how your work evolves in stages.

## Technology and Public Work

Please note that Moodle will remain our primary course interface, through which you'll submit your assignment links and your grades will be made available. Apart from Moodle, you're expected to learn/use a couple other learning and composing tools that might be new to you. 

1. Most of the digital readings I assign to you will happen via [Perusall](https://cteresources.bc.edu/documentation/perusall/). You'll find links to the Perusall page for the readings in the Moodle itself. But why am I asking you to learn this new tool and conduct our reading via it? Perusall is primarily a social annotation tool, meaning we read collaboratively as a class and share our comments/highlights on readings with each other. This collaboration and sharing will improve our engagement with the text, inform our class discussion, and help us build a shared and reciprocal understanding of rhetoric. There might be a bit of a learning curve at first but the tool is well-featured and documents, and I will supply a few videos at the start of the course get you off the ground. Here is an introductory video on Perusall titled: "[How to Use Perusall | Get Started with Social Learning](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ysn9nEZyKs)."
2. The other tool you will need to learn for the course is [ArcGIS StoryMaps](https://storymaps.arcgis.com/). This will be your primary composition tool for all the three projects in the course. Why am I asking you to learn this new tool and compose your writing in it? ArcGIS StoryMaps allows you to compose multimodal narratives. Some of its narrative tools are powerful, organic, and creative, when it comes to rhetoric. Though three of your writing projects will be quite different from each other, I want you to be creative, multimodal, intentional, and design-oriented when it comes to writing. Meaning, I want you to get out of a language-heavy way of thinking about writing and rhetoric. ArcGIS StoryMaps has diverse tools to meet the specific requirements for each assignment and at the same time help you think about rhetoric and writing in a holistic way. Here is an [introductory tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aVPUQTRrdfU) that should give you a generic idea of how the tool works, its interface, and its capabilities.  

Both these tools are free. And these tools are not meant to be a one-off thing, as I believe that learning them can have a lasting and generative impact on your reading and writing skills.

### Writing Assignments

There will be three major writing assignments in this course. More details for each project will be given in a separate handout at the start of the project.

1.  **Project 1/Rhetoric That Moves Us**: The first major writing assignment will be a synthesizing and rhetorical analysis essay with a primary focus on how emotion or affect plays a significant role in persuasion. The focus on emotion or affect is strategic in this case. Since in your academic or professional (or primarily Western) understanding of persuasion rationality and "objectivity" are prioritized and emotion/subjectivity is constantly devalued, you'll take a deliberate approach to reconfigure that thinking. The project is envisioned like this: 
	- You'll identify a piece of text in any genre or in any mode of communication that *moves* you. Note the critical word "move."
	- You'll do a close analysis of that piece of text and try to probe and understand *why* that text moves you and *how* emotion works as a rhetorical device to attain the text's goals
	- You must employ in your analysis the concepts you'll learn in our course readings, and these concepts will focus on the intersections of rhetoric, emotion, and climate activism. Also, in this step, you'll synthesize the concepts from the readings with your own research. Even though the readings will be primarily focused on climate activism and ecological consciousness, you can adapt the concepts to the particular text and rhetorical context you'll analyze.
	- Finally, you'll use ArcGIS StoryMaps to compose your essay. The expectation is that you'll leverage the multimodal, immersive, and interactive narrative capabilities of the tool to make your rhetorical analysis a unique reading experience.  
The length of the analysis should be 1200 words or more and you will be required to do close rhetorical reading of the text and incorporate relevant and complementary multimodal components. This project will proceed through a topic proposal, design outline, rough draft, and final draft. Points: 20%
2.  **Project 2/ Rhetoric that Connects Us**: In this project, you'll engage with an on-campus ecological issue and consider how to spotlight the issue better to inform the campus community and beyond. While the previous project focuses on the role of emotion in rhetoric, this project will emphasize what our immediate environment (in this case your campus) can teach us about rhetoric. The rationale of the project goes like this: to be a better rhetor one needs to be more ethical --> One way to develop and sharpen that ethical side is through mindfulness --> Mindfulness can be attained in many ways but how about paying attention to our immediate environment? --> Our immediate environment though is full of animate and non-animate beings (like soil, rocks, plants, animals, river, air, etc.), so how can we learn to pay attention to them? --> That act of learning and paying attention push us to **re-imagine** our relationship with our immediate environment and recognize that we're a deeply interconnected and interdependent specie --> We need to learn that our ability to persuade cannot bypass our necessity to forge kinship and reciprocity with a world full of people, animals, plants, and non-animate beings. The logistics of the project will look like this: 
	- Sue MacQueen, the Campus Engagement Coordinator at Swarthmore, will give us a tour of the Crum Woods and Scott Arboretum to help us become aware of the multiple ecological realities facing SWAT's campus and its community members. 
	- You will then choose one issue as your topic idea for Project 2 and develop a rhetorical campaign to draw more attention to the issue. Your campaign will take the shape of a rich multimodal slideshow, which can potentially include text, charts, video, audio, image, map, and other interactive elements. It's important that you bring your phone during our walk with Sue MacQueen so that you can take photos and record audio/video to incorporate into your project later. 
	- You'll use the "[Frames](https://storymaps.arcgis.com/stories/874d6937b9e242d283aafa1a816a9c0e)" feature of the ArcGIS Story Maps to compose your work. "Frames" are akin to PowerPoint slideshows, except "Frames" can have video/audio content and can be interactive. You can have up to 20 content slides in your "Frame."  
	- The final step of this project is to share your work with the campus community. Imagine this step as *presenting* your work to an audience. Part of your "frame" can include you presenting your work in a video in one of the slides.
	- Additionally, we need to ensure that your work reaches as many campus community members as possible. Circulating your work and strategically thinking of promoting it are integral part of rhetoric. If all goes well and provided we can secure the permission of the campus administration, you'll make your frame accessible through a QR code. We'll print these QR codes and you'll choose 1-3 strategic locations to paste this QR code to so that passers by can scan the code, access your presentation on their phone, and be informed about your chosen topic.  
This project will develop in stages such as proposing your topic idea, researching your topic, creating an outline for presentation, designing and composing the frame, "presenting" it, and writing a reflection essay. Points: 25%.
3.  **Project 3/Rhetoric that Embodies Us**: For this project, you'll learn a concept called embodied rhetoric and you'll be introduced to examples of how academic research essays can be personalized. You'll see examples of academic writers speaking of their body, personalizing their argument, using storytelling, and underscoring inseparableness of their mind and body to formulate an argument. We know that western academic writing standards prefer to keep subjectivity, affect, and bodily presence out of writing. This project will attempt to challenge such exclusions. 
	- As part of this project you will write a research essay on a topic or issue that's personal to you and you'll attempt to develop your academic argument by incorporating embodied rhetoric. 
	- Through the readings for this project, you will learn the prevalent role our bodies play in our thinking, arguments, and knowledge-making, and how, in your academic writing, you can bring your body to fore to strengths your argument and help your audience envision a complementary/alternate mode of academic thinking.  
	- Our readings will give your concrete examples of how you can disrupt academic conventions in constructive ways to propel your ideas and argument.
	- Your participation in Chester's annual march will also deepen your understanding of embodied rhetoric in a hands-on and practical way.  
	- Rhetorically, this project will complement the previous two. And overall, through the rhetoric of emotion, interrelationship and body, you'll develop more nuanced and multi-faceted ways of thinking about writing, arguing, and persuading.
	- You'll use ArcGIS Story Maps to compose a multimodal, interactive, and immersing academic essay. In fact, you'll be encouraged to find creative ways to leverage the narrative features of ArcGIS Story Maps to underscore the role of body in your writing and argument. 
The minimum word count of the essay will be 2,000. The project will develop in stages of topic idea, preliminary research, rough draft, instructor and peer feedback, revision goals, and final draft. Points: 30%.

### Grade Scale

The following grading scale will be used for writing assignments as well as final course grade:

- 93-100 = A; 90-92 = A-;  
- 87-89 = B+; 83-86 = B; 80-82 = B-;  
- 77-79 = C+; 73-76 = C; 70-72 = C-;  
- 67-69 = D+; 63-66 = D; 60-62 = D-; 59-0 = F

When rounding up your final grade, I will follow the practice described on the [website]((http://www.amsi.org.au/ESA_Resources/Q3450/Q3450_2.html)) of amsi.org, which stands for Australian Mathematical Sciences Institute. For example, 92.4 will get rounded to 92 but 92.5 will get rounded to 93.

### Reflection Assignments

Reflection will be a critical part of this course to assess your learning and develop metacognition. There will be three reflection assignments in total. Here are the details about the three reflection assignments:

- You will complete a final reflection assignment at the end of the semester. As part of this reflection, you will develop a personal theory of persuasion. Meaning, based on your learnings in the course, you will conceptualize a theory of persuasion and how you plan to adapt that theory to the future writing contexts. (Points 5%)
- After completing the guided tour of Scott Arboretum and Crum Woods with Sue MacQueen, you will compose a reflection about your observations. (Points 2.5%)
- After taking part in Chester community's annual protest for environmental justice, you will write a reflection about your observations at the protest and how the embodied rhetoric worked in that event. (Points 2.5%)

### Class Participation & Discussion Posts

You are expected to take class discussion very seriously, and you are expected to read the assigned readings thoroughly and critically. Your class participation grade (15%) will depend on your participation in class and your level of engagement with assigned readings. Here is a generic template on how readings and in-class discussions will work:
- Most of the course readings will take place via Perusall, in which we will add our questions and comments about the text that the class can see. Each of us will share at least 5 annotations and 2 replies per reading. 
- Each week a peer group will be in charge of leading the class discussion (the class will be divided into 3-4 peer groups called Learning Pods). Though this peer group will complete the reading on Perusall, they won't be required to do the minimum annotations and replies expected from the rest of us. Rather, this peer group will help synthesize the rest of the class's annotations and facilitate the in-class discussion that follows. 
- I have put together [a document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-XVtsO1G1xZ3V6dM84sS1V7qayoy6L6iLeMpRt2uM6U/edit?usp=sharing) on how to use Perusall, how to annotate, and how your annotations will be graded. Please take a loot at these guidelines to set correct expectations for yourself and make the best use of Perusall. Note that your annotations in Perusall need to be completed at least an hour before the class start time so that the peer group leading the class discussion can read your annotations beforehand and come to class prepared to facilitate the class discussion. 
- The peer group facilitator will go over the class's comments and questions and they will make a collage or list of selected annotations that they think capture the dominant themes and patters in the annotations, that advance our conversation on rhetoric, and that suitably place the class to meet the challenges of the writing projects.
- The annotation collage that the peer group facilitator puts together will go into a discussion post in Moodle. The group will give the class some time to go over the collage and the group will give the class five minutes to write about key patterns and themes observable in the collage. This timed writing activity will be an individual exercise. Each student will post their response in Moodle. 
- We, as a class, will go over these written responses, and the peer group facilitator will then lead an open-ended discussion to hash out ideas, generate more questions, develop more synthesis, generate more dialogue, present more insights, and so on.
- The class period will end with an instructor-assigned writing/learning activity, which will serve as a "transition point" between the reading/discussion for the day and to prepare for the reading or learning task ahead.  

### Extra Writing Help

[The Writing Center at Swarthmore](https://www.swarthmore.edu/writing/writing-center) can be a great source for getting additional writing help. This service is free to all students. The Writing Center is located at Trotter Hall 120. At the Writing Center you can get pre-writing help, feedback on your written draft, and a potential reader for your work. I highly encourage you to avail of this service. If you need more persuasion on how the writing center can be highly beneficial, then check the essay "[Why Visit Your Campus Writing Center?](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1rKSAeR9PWQ9mFScrMQcF5T-wnv9R4M_V/view)" by Ben Rafoth.

### Learning Outcomes

The following learning outcomes will be prioritized in this course:

### Attendance Policy

We will meet in-person on Tuesdays/Thursdays on scheduled class time.

- Attendance will be taken during each meeting. You can track your attendance via Moodle.
- Please avoid arriving late for class or leaving early. If for any reason you need to do either, please check with me.
- You're allowed a maximum of **3 absences (excused or unexcused)** over the course of the semester. Absences beyond that might result in a failing grade, unless the cause of absence is due to extenuating circumstances and you supply official documentation attesting the cause. Despite the cause of absence, students are expected to complete missed readings, discussion posts, and writing assignments.

### Late Work

You're allowed late submission for any **two** assignments. Think of it as a lifeline. Be it Rough Draft, Peer Review Draft, Final Draft, reflection assignment, or a discussion post, you've a 48-hour grace period from the deadline to submit your work. Please remember, **you can use the lifeline only twice**, no questions asked, and within 48 hours of the official deadline. And once you use the lifeline, late submissions might not be accepted.

### Submitting Your Assignment

There will be no paper-based submission in this course. You'll submit to Moodle the link to your ArcGIS Story Maps work. Submissions such as reflection essays must be done via Moodle as a .pdf or .docx file. Please don't submit assignments in .pages or .wps format, as I am not able to open them.

### Plagiarism and Academic Integrity

Any work that you submit at any stage of the writing process---draft, thesis and outline, bibliography, discussion post, etc.---must be your own work. In addition, any words, ideas, or data that you borrow from other sources must be properly cited. Failure to do either of these can amount to plagiarism or violation of academic integrity. Penalties for such offenses can include major course penalties or possibly failure of the course and can result in reporting to the office of Dean of Student Life. The [student handbook](https://www.swarthmore.edu/student-handbook/academic-policies#academic_misconduct) is your best guide to gain clarity on these academic policies.

### Use of AI

I am highly skeptical of AI and its capabilities, when it comes to writing. I am still learning about AI and developing my thoughts on it and trying to figure out when and how to allow my students to use AI. But for this course, which is about exploring symbiotic relationship between emotions, ecology, body, and rhetoric, it will be counterproductive to offload your work to generative AI. Moreover, writing is *about* process, scaffolding one's argument in stages, embracing the material realities of the writing process, becoming familiar with one's own writing strengths and weaknesses, and experiencing the struggles of writing as a cognitive, embodied, and emotional act. Trying to sidestep these aspects of writing through generative AI defeats the purpose of taking a writing course. Moreover there are other risks to consider when using generative AI, as articulated by this [note](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1pYLQQ5bTIy5Mny_trjYiBpjEcFEuqF9d8UOxHPGNa28) from the Writing Associates (WA) Program at Swarthmore: 
>AI literacy requires critical engagement with big-picture considerations. **Accuracy**: LLMs aren’t really intelligent; they are probabilistic models that mimic natural language without understanding. They can make things up and have no built-in fact-checker. **Bias**: AI models are built on enormous datasets and reflect the biases inherent in the texts and images on which they are trained. Their outputs can reflect and perpetuate those biases. **Privacy**: Information uploaded in queries, including personal identifiers, can sometimes be harvested back out, and uploading other people’s work can breach intellectual property law. **Monetization**: AI models are profit-driven endeavors. If a tool is free, you and/or your data are often the product. **Environment**: AI tools require massive amounts of electricity and water, contributing to global climate concerns.

In sum though, I am not imposing a total ban on the use of generative AI for the course; rather, I want to discourage you from using generative AI to complete any writing task or assigned reading for the course. There's a crucial distinction here. The lack of complete ban means that there's some room for negotiation and dialogue on the use of generative AI in case of certain learning activities. However, there're a few important considerations: 1) First, I want you to be more proactive and forthcoming with me if you plan to use generative AI for a particular writing stage or learning activity for the course. Please think of it as obtaining permission first, before using generative AI. 2) The use of generative AI can be permissible in areas such as conducting research or generating an outline. 3) Informing me beforehand about your interest in using generative AI will NOT impact your grade and it will NOT impact my estimation of you. In fact, I will take this as an opportunity to learn more about your learning needs and support you. 4) I may also route your request via Library and Academic Technology at SWAT who has an [excellent document](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Mm1NXIuiQ-XkRq1KXBJjMby3zTppBSzR) on how to enlist their service on responsible and ethical use of generative AI. 5) Finally, to be clear, the use of generative AI is NOT permissible to generate content for reading responses or writing assignments.     

###  Accommodation Policy

I want all students to have the best possible chance to succeed in this course and those include neurodiverse learners. If you believe you need accommodations for a disability or a chronic medical condition, please contact Student Disability Services via email at [studentdisabilityservices@swarthmore.edu](mailto:studentdisabilityservices@swarthmore.edu) to arrange an appointment to discuss your needs. As appropriate, the office will issue students with documented disabilities or medical conditions a formal Accommodations Letter. Since accommodations require early planning and are not retroactive, please contact Student Disability Services as soon as possible. For details about the accommodations process, [visit the Student Disability Services website](https://www.swarthmore.edu/office-academic-success/welcome-to-student-disability-services). You are also welcome to contact me, your instructor, privately to discuss your academic needs. However, all disability-related accommodations must be arranged, in advance, through Student Disability Services.

### Sexual Misconduct & Title IX 

As a Swarthmore employee, I'm required by law to report any disclosures of sexual assault or harassment to the Title IX Coordinator. These reports are private, but must include identifiable information about the victim. The reporting will include the date, time, location (on or off-campus) of assault, and whether or not the victim and/or perpetrator are Swarthmore students. Once the Title IX Coordinator receives a report, they will send the victim information about support and resources, and invite them to come in for assistance. While the College has an obligation to reach out to provide resources and assess campus safety, the victim is not required to participate in a meeting or possible investigation. More specific information and resources are available at [Sexual Harassment/Assault Resources & Education](https://www.swarthmore.edu/share/). 

### Other Campus Resources

Swarthmore provides a range of resources for your personal excellence, well-being, and academic success. Please avail of these resources/services to succeed in this course and your academic career. If there is any source you're aware of that you think your peers will benefit from but not listed here, please suggest them here using the comment feature.

### Important: Out-of-class Expectation

As part of Project 3 and to experience embodied rhetoric in a specific way, you're expected to attend the annual environmental justice march on **DATE TB** (it usually happens in mid April or early May on a Saturday) organized by [CRCQL](https://chesterpaej.org/about/) (pronounced "circle") at Chester (7.5 miles from the campus). CRCQL is a grassroots organization founded by [Chester, PA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chester,_Pennsylvania), community members in 1992 to protest against [Covanta's](https://whyy.org/articles/public-pressure-mounts-against-chester-incinerator-as-environmental-racism-claims-pile-up/) toxic trash incinerator in their community. The annual, peaceful march has been Chester community's way of drawing attention to environmental racism, bringing onboard allies from Chester's neighboring communities, pressurizing local+state+federal government to help clean up Chester's toxic pollution, holding Covanta accountable, and asserting the civil rights of the community. The participation in the protest will require up to 4 hours of your time on a Saturday, including the time it will take to be transported from campus to Chester and back. I have canceled the **April X** class to compensate for protest participation though I realize that it's not an equitable compensation time-wise. I do believe though your participation in this protest will be a truly hands-on learning experience. I hope you'll consider this course expectation earnestly. Please take a note of the following details:

- Transportation will be provided for you from campus to the protest site. I will provide you more information to help you feel confident, informed, and prepared for this protest. Trust me, your physical presence at the protest is the most important thing. The atmosphere is usually lively, inviting and contagious, and once you're there you cannot help but immerse yourself in the energy of the crowd.
- This will be a peaceful protest.
- Note that Swarthmore College has a history of cooperating with CRCQL. Each year a few faculties take their students to the protest. This year might turn out to be no different. You might see some friends there apart from your classmates. Notably, on-campus student group Campus Coalition Concerning Chester (C4) has collaborated with CRCQL in a range of capacities. Here is a [statement](https://www.swarthmore.edu/lang-center/environment-sustainability) from the group:

> The Campus Coalition Concerning Chester (C4) @ Swarthmore is a student-chapter organization dedicated to building alliances between local colleges and Chester Residents Concerned for Quality Living (CRCQL). Through these relationships, we hope to collectively spearhead and support initiatives that promote environmental justice in Pennsylvania. Furthermore, we hope to interrogate our own college communities' complicities and roles in this injustice and implement institutional-level solutions for equitable waste management. C-4 mobilizes community and empowers all citizens to contribute to a sustainably just society.

- After attending the protest, you will complete a reflection activity on your experience and your take on embodied rhetoric.
- You have the option to opt out of the protest for a reasonable excuse. In that case, you will be expected to complete a make-up assignment, the details of which I will share later in the semester.
- Please confirm by Jan 31 whether you'll be able to attend the protest. (the confirmation form will be shared with you later)

## Quote 1
Looking back...I can see how quickly the neatness of a [writing project's] plan falls apart once it meets the reality of participants and their unpredictability, which pushed me to adjust my expectations and work with what I had rather than what I pictured. It also showed me that the ambition I brought into the project had to coexist with a more grounded understanding that academic work often requires flexibility, even when I want it to be perfect.

## Quote 2
I believe that to succeed in academic writing at the university level, especially in papers that analyze materials from different disciplines, the most crucial skill is the ability to understand what articles from different fields are actually doing—that is, to identify their purpose, ideas, and target audience—and to analyze and explain them using their respective conventions, rather than simply summarizing everything in one's own words.

## Quote 3
[I learned] the importance of reflecting on my work and ensuring that I have audience-awareness when writing. Having audience-awareness is something that is extremely important when writing in an academic setting. The biggest takeaway I learned from my work is that in order to be successful in college academic writing, one must be able to reflect and adapt the writing based on the standards of the audience.

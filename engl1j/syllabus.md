## Course Description

This course will ask students to explore the tools of oral and written persuasion across academic and non-academic writing genres. Students will engage with such questions as how do we listen and empathize with a diverse range of views in order to argue from one's own position? How does the motivation "to persuade" shape a rhetorical situation? How do we use a range of resources, such as rhetorical traditions, genre knowledge, and multimodality, to speak to different audiences? Students will be able to critically examine how persuasion works in their own communications and the communications of others in real contexts.

The theme of the course will be environmental awareness and environmental rhetoric. Focus will be specifically on different modes of rhetoric that inform environmental rhetoric and how knowledge of such rhetoric can lead to better ecological consciousness. Too often the understanding of rhetoric (meaning the ability to persuade someone) is limited to the classical Western and anthropocentric standards on the subject. This course offers *other* understandings of rhetoric such as animal rhetoric, multimodal/multisensory rhetoric, indigenous rhetorical traditions, and embodied rhetoric. With your introduction to these different types of rhetoric, you will be in a position to develop a diverse way of thinking about rhetoric/persuasion and consider its application in your daily reality. Even though the topical focus of this course is on environmental awareness and ecological issues, the different types of rhetoric you will learn in this course can inform your ability to persuade in a range of academic, personal and professional communication situations.

There will be three projects that you will complete in this course:

1.  You will conduct rhetorical analysis of a persuasion campaign employed by an organization or entity dedicated to climate action (for example analyzing persuasion strategies adopted by the Office of Sustainability at Swarthmore in their public-facing communication genres); in this assignment you will use the rhetorical concepts you have learned and readings up to Week 5 to conduct rhetorical analysis.
2.  You will do a poster presentation to the Swarthmore community on an ecological issue of your choice after completing a guided tour of the Crum Woods and Scott Arboretum. You will also present an argument as part of the presentation, you will invite the community's feedback on the topic, and you will write a final reflection paper on what you learned in terms of the rhetorical engagement your topic demands.
3.  You will write a research essay on a topic that stretches the norms and expectations of academic writing (by that I mean the Western standards of academic rhetoric). This is a more open-ended project, meaning you can write on topics not limited to environmentalism. Nevertheless, the rhetorical strategies you employ to complicate and problematize the genre of academic research essay should be informed by embodied rhetoric, a concept that you will learn through our in-class readings and discussions, and out-of-class activities.

## Schedule

[Weekly schedule](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Xap6w0ItqECAFM57fx51bg8TxJh9N_HXiBTD3Yeue9I/edit?usp=sharing) for the course is available for your review.

##  Texts

- *Out of the Woods: Seeing Nature in the Everyday* by Julia Corbett, First Edition, ISBN 978-1943859887. This is a required text and students are expected to purchase a copy.
- Other readings in the course will come from scholarly journals, book chapters, and web sources, and they will be made available to you in html or pdf format.

## Grade Distribution

Total course grade (100%) will be divided into several components:

1.  Writing projects (three in total): 75%
2.  Class participation & discussion posts: 15%
3.  Reflection assignments: 10%

One note on the grade distribution: commitment to the writing process will play a crucial role in this course and it is factored in the different stages involved in each writing assignment. It's important that you complete all the components of each assignment, and pay attention to and document how your work evolves in stages.

### Writing Assignments

There will be three major writing assignments in this course. More details for each project will be given in a separate handout at the start of the project.

1.  **Project 1/Rhetorical Analysis**: The first major writing assignment will be a rhetorical analysis essay and you will analyze a specific persuasive genre employed by a local, national or international organization dedicated to climate action, environmental rhetoric or sustainability. For example, if you choose Swarthmore's Office of Sustainability as your chosen organization then you can focus on one of the communications by the Office to advance its mission and responsibilities through various persuasive strategies. Please note that you have to choose only **one** communication example ( an email, a particular campaign, a flier, an executive plan, an in-person event, etc.) for your analysis. The length of the analysis should be 1500 words or more and you will be required to do close rhetorical reading of the text and incorporate at least three or more rhetorical concepts you learned in the textbook *The Essential Guide to Rhetoric*. This project will proceed through a topic proposal, rough draft, and final draft. Points: 20%
2.  **Project 2/ Poster Presentation**: The purpose of the second project is to engage with an on-campus ecological issue and consider what sort of environmental rhetoric can be used to better spotlight the issue for the campus community and beyond. Sue MacQueen, the Campus Engagement Coordinator at Swarthmore, will give you a tour of the Crum Woods and Scott Arboretum in Week #7 to help you become aware of the multiple ecological realities facing SWAT's campus and its community members. You will then choose one issue as your topic idea for Project 2 and develop a rhetorical campaign to draw more attention to the issue. Your campaign will take the shape of a [conference-style poster presentation](https://www.bu.edu/asor/am/2017/documents/poster-tips.pdf). This presentation will happen in a live "conference-like"event at a public venue and in which anyone from the campus community will be invited to participate. As part of the presentation you will design and print an A2 size poster, which should include the following components about your chosen ecological issue: brief introduction to the issue, how it connects to the larger world, why anyone should care about it, and what needs to be done to draw more attention to the issue. When presenting your poster to the audience at the event, you should account for two things. First, you should have a 2-3 minute "elevator pitch" ready to make your audience aware and care about the issue. You will prepare for this formal presentation part with the help of a [Speaking Associate (SPA)](https://www.swarthmore.edu/writing/spas-speaking-associates). Second, your presentation should have an informal aspect to it, which will be conversational and interactive. As part of it, you will invite feedback from the audience on your rhetorical strategies and make note of their inputs. To cap the project, you will write a reflection paper on what rhetorical strategies of your own you brought to spotlight the issue, why, what feedback from the audience you received, and what revised rhetorical strategies you would propose. This project will develop in stages such as proposing your topic idea, researching your topic, creating an outline for presentation, designing the poster, presenting your poster, and completing a reflection activity. Points: 25%.
3.  **Project 3/Personalizing the Academic**: For this project, you'll learn a concept called embodied rhetoric and you'll be introduced to examples of how academic research essays can be personalized. You'll see examples of academic writers speaking of their body, personalizing their argument, using storytelling, and underscoring inseparableness of their mind and body to formulate an argument. We know that western academic writing standards prefer to keep subjectivity, affect, and bodily presence out of writing. This project will attempt to challenge such exclusion. So as part of this project you will write a research essay on a topic of issue that's personal to you and you'll attempt to develop your academic argument by incorporating embodied rhetoric. From the examples we will analyze as part of this project, you will come to know of different ways embodied rhetoric work and how you can develop your argument in your essay through embodied as well as other types of rhetoric you will have learned in the course so far. The minimum word count of the essay will be 2000. You will be encouraged to compose and incorporate multimodal components to extend and enrich the persuasive power of your argument. The project will develop in stages such as proposing your topic idea, conducting preliminary research, rough draft, instructor and peer feedback, setting revision goals, and final draft. Points: 30%.

### Grade Scale

The following grading scale will be used for writing assignments as well as final course grade:

- 93-100 = A; 90-92 = A-;  
- 87-89 = B+; 83-86 = B; 80-82 = B-;  
- 77-79 = C+; 73-76 = C; 70-72 = C-;  
- 67-69 = D+; 63-66 = D; 60-62 = D-; 59-0 = F

When rounding up your final grade, I will follow the convention described on this [web page](http://www.amsi.org.au/ESA_Resources/Q3450/Q3450_2.html). For example, 92.4 will get rounded to 92 but 92.5 will get rounded to 93.]

### Reflection Assignments

Reflection will be a critical part of this course to assess your learning and develop metacognition. There will be three reflection assignments in total. Here are some details about the three reflection assignments:

- You will complete one reflection assignment at the end of the semester. You will develop a personal theory of persuasion, meaning, based on your interest and learnings in the course, you will conceptualize a theory of persuasion and how you plan to adapt that theory as the writing context, genre, and audience expectations will change from one writing context to another. (Points 5%)
- After completing the guided tour of Scott Arboretum and Crum Woods with Sue MacQueen, you will compose a reflection about your observations. (Points 2.5%)
- After taking part in Chester community's annual protest for environmental justice, you will write a reflection about your observations at the protest and how the embodied rhetoric worked in that event. (Points 2.5%)

### Class Participation & Discussion Posts

You are expected to take class discussion very seriously, and you are expected to read the assigned readings thoroughly and critically and respond to the discussion post prompt on Moodle before class time. Your class participation grade (15%) will depend on the frequency of your participation in class and insightfulness of your comments. You're also expected to respond to the discussion prompt in Moodle before the start of class.

### Extra Writing Help

[The Writing Center at Swarthmore](https://www.swarthmore.edu/writing/writing-center) can be a great source for getting additional writing help. This service is free to all students. The Writing Center is located at Trotter Hall 120. At the Writing Center you can get pre-writing help, feedback on your written draft, and a potential reader for your work. I highly encourage you to avail of this service. If you need more persuasion on how the writing center can be highly beneficial, then check the essay "[Why Visit Your Campus Writing Center?](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1rKSAeR9PWQ9mFScrMQcF5T-wnv9R4M_V/view)" by Ben Rafoth.

### Attendance Policy

We will meet in-person on Tuesdays/Thursdays on scheduled class time.

- Attendance will be taken during each meeting. You can track your attendance via Moodle.
- Please avoid arriving late for class or leaving early. If for any reason you need to do either, please check with me.
- You're allowed a maximum of **3 absences (excused or unexcused)** over the course of the semester. Absences beyond that might result in a failing grade, unless the cause of absence is due to extenuating circumstances and you supply official documentation attesting the cause. Despite the cause of absence, students are expected to complete missed readings, discussion posts, and writing assignments.

### Late Work

You're allowed late submission for any **two** assignments. Think of it as a lifeline. Be it Rough Draft, Peer Review Draft, Final Draft, reflection assignment, or a discussion post, you've a 48-hour grace period from the deadline to submit your work. Please remember, **you can use the lifeline only twice**, no questions asked, and within 48 hours of the official deadline. And once you use the lifeline, late submissions might not be accepted.

### Submit the Wrong File

There will be no paper-based submission in this course. All your assignments will be submitted via Moodle. Because of the digital nature of the submission, it's your responsibility to double check that you've submitted the correct version of the assignment. Unless I receive the correct file by the deadline, your work will be deemed as late or not submitted. Also, please don't submit assignments in .pages or .wps format.

### Plagiarism and Academic Integrity

Any work that you submit at any stage of the writing process---draft, thesis and outline, bibliography, discussion post, etc.---must be your own work. In addition, any words, ideas, or data that you borrow from other sources must be properly cited. Failure to do either of these can amount to plagiarism or violation of academic integrity. Penalties for such offenses can include major course penalties or possibly failure of the course and can result in reporting to the office of Dean of Student Life. For more information on this topic, please consult this link: [https://www.swarthmore.edu/student-handbook/academic-policies#academic_misconduct](https://www.swarthmore.edu/student-handbook/academic-policies#academic_misconduct)

### Use of AI

I am highly skeptical of AI and its capabilities when it comes to writing. I am still learning about AI and developing my thoughts on when and how to allow my students to use AI. The Writing Associates Program at Swarthmore, which oversees this course, is also in the midst of developing its policies on AI. But please know there's consensus among AI experts that AI technology is prone to inaccuracies, biases, and "hallucinations" that doesn't lead to a thoughtful and sophisticated academic argument, which you need to demonstrate to pass this course. You're allowed to use AI bots only to brainstorm on a topic and further your research but in those cases you'll have to notify me the extent to which you're using AI and why. If it comes to my notice that you've used the help of AI to write any part of your classwork and you haven't alerted me beforehand, then it might amount to plagiarism and I may consider reporting the case to college administration. But note that using any AI-based grammar or spellchecker is acceptable.

###  Accommodation Policy

I want all students to have the best possible chance to succeed in this course and those include neurodiverse learners. If you believe you need accommodations for a disability or a chronic medical condition, please contact Student Disability Services via email at [studentdisabilityservices@swarthmore.edu](mailto:studentdisabilityservices@swarthmore.edu) to arrange an appointment to discuss your needs. As appropriate, the office will issue students with documented disabilities or medical conditions a formal Accommodations Letter. Since accommodations require early planning and are not retroactive, please contact Student Disability Services as soon as possible. For details about the accommodations process, [visit the Student Disability Services website](https://www.swarthmore.edu/office-academic-success/welcome-to-student-disability-services). You are also welcome to contact me, your instructor, privately to discuss your academic needs. However, all disability-related accommodations must be arranged, in advance, through Student Disability Services.

### Sexual Misconduct & Title IX 

As a Swarthmore employee, I'm required by law to report any disclosures of sexual assault or harassment to the Title IX Coordinator. These reports are private, but must include identifiable information about the victim. The reporting will include the date, time, location (on or off-campus) of assault, and whether or not the victim and/or perpetrator are Swarthmore students. Once the Title IX Coordinator receives a report, they will send the victim information about support and resources, and invite them to come in for assistance. While the College has an obligation to reach out to provide resources and assess campus safety, the victim is not required to participate in a meeting or possible investigation. More specific information and resources are available at [Sexual Harassment/Assault Resources & Education](https://www.swarthmore.edu/share/). 

### Other Campus Resources

Swarthmore provides a range of resources for your personal excellence, well-being, and academic success. Please avail of these resources/services to succeed in this course and your academic career. If there is any source you're aware of that you think your peers will benefit from but not listed here, please suggest them here using the comment feature.

### Important: Out-of-class Expectation

As part of Project 3 and to experience embodied rhetoric in a specific way, you're expected to attend the annual environmental justice march on **DATE TBD** (it usually happens in mid April and on a Saturday) organized by [CRCQL](https://chesterpaej.org/about/) (pronounced "circle") at Chester (7.5 miles from the campus). CRCQL is a grassroot organization founded by [Chester, PA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chester,_Pennsylvania), community members in 1992 to protest against [Covanta's](https://whyy.org/articles/public-pressure-mounts-against-chester-incinerator-as-environmental-racism-claims-pile-up/) toxic trash incinerator in their community. The annual, peaceful march has been Chester community's way to draw attention to environmental racism, draw allies from Chester's neighboring communities, pressurize local+state+federal government to help clean up Chester's toxic pollution, hold Covanta accountable, and assert the civil rights of the community. The participation in the protest will require up to 4 hours of your time on a Saturday, including the time it will take to be transported from campus to Chester and back. I have canceled the April 18 class to compensate for protest participation though I realize that it's not an equitable compensation time-wise. I do believe though your participation in this protest will be a truly hands-on learning experience for you. I hope you'll consider this course expectation earnestly. Please take a note of the following details:

- Transportation will be provided for you from campus to the protest site. I will provide you more information to help you feel confident, informed, and prepared for this protest. Trust me your physical presence at the protest is the most important thing. The atmosphere is usually lively, inviting and contagious, and once you're there you cannot help but immerse yourself in the energy of the crowd.
- As I have mentioned in class, this will be a peaceful protest.
- Note that Swarthmore College has a history of cooperating with CRCQL. Each year a few faculties take their students to the protest. This year will be no different. So you might see some friends there apart from your classmates. Notably, on-campus student group Campus Coalition Concerning Chester (C4) has collaborated with CRCQL in a range of capacities. The [statement](https://www.swarthmore.edu/lang-center/environment-sustainability) from the group:

> The Campus Coalition Concerning Chester (C4) @ Swarthmore is a student-chapter organization dedicated to building alliances between local colleges and Chester Residents Concerned for Quality Living (CRCQL). Through these relationships, we hope to collectively spearhead and support initiatives that promote environmental justice in Pennsylvania. Furthermore, we hope to interrogate our own college communities' complicities and roles in this injustice and implement institutional-level solutions for equitable waste management. C-4 mobilizes community and empowers all citizens to contribute to a sustainably just society.

- After attending the protest, you will complete a reflection activity on your experience and your take on embodied rhetoric.
- You have the option to opt out of the protest for a reasonable cause. In that case, you will be expected to complete a make-up assignment, the details of which I will share later.
- Please confirm by Jan 31 whether you're able to attend the protest. (a Google form link will be shared with you soon)
